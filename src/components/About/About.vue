  	<p>Thanks for trying out skateLocate - Made for skaters to help locate locate spots easily.</p>
  	<p>When I came to London I had no idea there were so many, so thought it would be good to document them.</p>
  	<p>If you've got a spot to share, click 'add' in the top left and left click (or tap if you're on a mobile) on the location to begin adding. You'll need to add in your name and the park name. But if you wanna write a short description or have an image then please do add it too!</p>
  	<p>Hoping on getting an offline mode developed, so when you're on your way out skating and wanna check quickly you can do!</p>
